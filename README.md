# Security-Token-Offering-STO-
This high-level Solidity script represents a basic implementation of an STO platform. It includes the following features:

    Token issuance: The issueTokens function allows the issuance of security tokens to investors who have passed the KYC verification and are accredited.

    KYC verification: The verifyKYC function verifies the KYC status of an investor before issuing tokens to them.

    Investor accreditation: The accreditInvestor function performs checks to ensure that an investor is accredited before allowing them to participate in the token offering.

    Token transfer: The transferTokens function allows token holders to transfer tokens to other addresses, maintaining the necessary balance checks.

    State variables: The contract includes state variables to store the token name, symbol, total supply, KYC status, accredited investor status, and token balances.

    Events: Events are emitted to provide transparency and traceability for token issuances, KYC verifications, investor accreditations, and token transfers.
